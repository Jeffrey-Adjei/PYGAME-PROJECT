# PYGAME-PROJECT

TASK

The overall task in this coursework is to create a Python program to allow a human player to play the Notty game against one or two computer opponents.You must use the Pygame framework to implement this.

You should include the following in your solution:
A simulation of the collection of cards and the basic gameplay, including the initial dealing of the cards, the turn-taking structure, the playing of the three actions, checking that actions are valid and denying ones that are not, maintaining the deck and shuffling it when needed, checking for the winning condition, and declaring the winner.


You should use the facilities in Pygame to create a visual interface to the game, so that the user can see the cards by all players, play the game by clicking on cards/buttons or similar, and where the various actions by the human and computer players are visualised appropriately in the interface.


You should implement computer players for the game. Initially, this can consist of computing which of the three actions are possible, choosing one of the possible actions at random, and passing if none are possible. Later on, you could add sophistication to the computer players: for example, the computer might calculate which is the best of the three actions to take (or whether it is better to pass); how many cards to draw when taking a draw action; which player to take from when taking a random card from another player; and, which is the best valid group to discard when there is a choice of possible valid sets. This is an open-ended part of the assessment, and you should use your creativity to come up with interesting strategies for the computer players to use. For the highest marks, you should implement multiple computer players, each taking a different approach, and the user can choose which players to play against.


You should add a button to the interface called Play for Me which makes the computer player take your turn for you.


When a player (human or computer) wins, the program should display a congratulations message.
